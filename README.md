ParserService
=============

This is an interview question.
This project is designed in Java with IntelliJ IDEA. There are three files based on the requirements. One is the executable jar file called Assignment.jar. One is the source code which includes two java file. The ParserService includes the two queries and the resultObject  is the class that I created to store the information for each certain object.

How to run the program?
Query 1: (requires a single argument)
java -jar Assignment.jar <keyword> (e.g. java -jar Assignment.jar "baby strollers")
Query 2: (requires two arguments)
java -jar Assignment.jar <keyword> <page number> (e.g. java -jar Assignment.jar "baby strollers" "2")
Note: the key words can only have the space as the seperation. And for query 2, the page number should input as a string, such as "2".

I used the Jsoup 1.7.2 which is a java library for working with real-world HTML.
